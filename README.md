Forma LMS v2.3.0 compatible with PHP <= 7.2

All files have been checked to maximize compatibility with php 7.2 and below.

I used php version 7.2.24 under Ubuntu 18.04, there may be errors with higher versions.

Some functions have been corrected because errors persisted.

There are still some malfunctions to correct but which are not blocking. I will update the code when the corrections are made.

Finally, I made changes to the templates, such as adding private message notifications to the menu bar.
